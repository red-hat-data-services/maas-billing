# MaaS Platform Documentation

Welcome to the Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) Platform documentation.

The MaaS Platform enhances the model serving capabilities of [Open Data Hub](https://github.com/opendatahub-io) by adding a management layer for self-service access control, rate limiting, and tier-based subscriptions.

Use this platform to streamline the deployment of your models, monitor usage, and effectively manage costs.
