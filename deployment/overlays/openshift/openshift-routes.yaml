# OpenShift Route for MaaS API administrative access
# 
# IMPORTANT: This route provides direct access to the MaaS API service for:
#   - Token management (creation/revocation)
#   - Administrative operations
#   - Health checks and monitoring
#
# For model inference requests, use the Gateway route (gateway-route.yaml) which:
#   - Enforces authentication policies
#   - Applies rate limiting
#   - Manages token-based access control
#
# Direct routes to models bypass TokenRateLimitPolicy and should NEVER be created
